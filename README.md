## Announcement

We’re excited to announce the new Cloud Native Databases devroom for [FOSDEM
2025](https://fosdem.org/). The purpose of this devroom is to discuss developing databases that
are designed to take advantage of the cloud native architecture in order to
meet the demands of modern applications.

Over the past decade, there have been many open source communities that
developed distributed SQL databases to provide scalability, cost efficiency
and manageability in the cloud. However, there is still work to be done for
on-going challenges such as network latency and security.

Instead of focusing on a single technology or community, our goal is to
bring open source database communities and developers together to share
their experience, learn from their work, and foster collaboration on
challenges ahead.
