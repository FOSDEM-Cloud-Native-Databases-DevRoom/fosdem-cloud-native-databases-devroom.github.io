## Announcement

We’re excited to announce the return of Cloud Native Databases (or Databases for short) devroom for [FOSDEM
2026](https://fosdem.org/2026/). The purpose of this devroom is to discuss developing databases that are designed to take advantage of the cloud native architecture in order to meet the demands of modern applications.


Instead of focusing on a single technology or community, our goal is to
bring open source database communities and developers together to share
their experience, learn from their work, and foster collaboration on
challenges ahead.
