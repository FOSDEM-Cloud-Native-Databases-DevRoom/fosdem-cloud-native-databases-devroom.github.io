The purpose of this devroom is to discuss developing databases that
can meet the demands of modern applications.

Instead of focusing on a single technology or community, our goal is to
bring open source database communities and developers together to share
their experience, learn from their work, and foster collaboration on
challenges ahead.

## Where

[FOSDEM 2026](https://fosdem.org/2026/) will be hosted in person at [ULB Solbosch Campus, Brussels, Belgium](https://fosdem.org/2026/practical/transportation/).

*   FOSDEM is a [FLOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) community event, so please ensure your topic is appropriate (i.e., no sales pitches).
