# Cloud Native Databases DevRoom at FOSDEM 2025

We’re excited to announce the new Cloud Native Databases devroom for [FOSDEM
2025](https://fosdem.org/). The purpose of this devroom is to discuss developing databases that
are designed to take advantage of the cloud native architecture in order to
meet the demands of modern applications.

Over the past decade, there have been many open source communities that
developed distributed SQL databases to provide scalability, cost efficiency
and manageability in the cloud. However, there is still work to be done for
on-going challenges such as network latency and security.

Instead of focusing on a single technology or community, our goal is to
bring open source database communities and developers together to share
their experience, learn from their work, and foster collaboration on
challenges ahead.

## Where

FOSDEM 2025 will be hosted in person at [ULB Solbosch Campus, Brussels, Belgium](https://fosdem.org/2025/practical/transportation/).

## Important Dates

*   CFP submission deadline: 1 December, 2024 (at ~23:55 Brussels time)
*   Devroom schedule announced: 15 December, 2024
*   Devroom takes place: **1 February, 2025** (in the afternoon)

## Suggested Topics

Since this is the first time we’re organizing our devroom, we don’t have
examples from past FOSDEM that we can point to. However, here are some
suggestions.

*   Evolution of new database architecture for cloud native environments (e.g., to address  scalability, elasticity, reliability)
*   How to ease/streamline database migration (especially from legacy
   databases)
*   Security and compliance for cloud native databases
*   Cloud cost optimization for users
*   Achieving database upgrades without downtime
*   How to benchmark and tune distributed databases
*   Query optimization for cloud native databases
*   Tools/methodologies for monitoring, observability, testing, etc.
*   Working with streaming data
*   Stories from end-users (both successes and failures)
*   State of open-source licenses and database communities
*   Emerging trends/use cases

These are just ideas and we encourage you to be creative with your
proposals!

A few Notes:

*   You must be available in person to present your talk at FOSDEM.
*   Speaking slots are 25 minutes in length (including Q&A) with 5 minutes between sessions.
*   FOSDEM is a [FLOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) community event, so please ensure your topic is appropriate (i.e., no sales pitches).

## To Submit

Go to the FOSDEM 2025 [Pretalx website](https://pretalx.fosdem.org/fosdem-2025/cfp) to submit your talks and
select “Cloud Native Databases” in the Track dropdown menu. 

Submissions on Pretalx will be open by 30 October.
