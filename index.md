The purpose of this devroom is to discuss developing databases that
are designed to take advantage of the cloud native architecture in order to
meet the demands of modern applications.

Over the past decade, there have been many open source communities that
developed distributed SQL databases to provide scalability, cost efficiency
and manageability in the cloud. However, there is still work to be done for
on-going challenges such as network latency and security.

Instead of focusing on a single technology or community, our goal is to
bring open source database communities and developers together to share
their experience, learn from their work, and foster collaboration on
challenges ahead.

## Where

[FOSDEM 2026](https://fosdem.org/2026/) will be hosted in person at [ULB Solbosch Campus, Brussels, Belgium](https://fosdem.org/2026/practical/transportation/).

## Important Dates

*   CFP submission deadline: 5 December, 2025 (at ~23:55 Brussels time)
*   Devroom schedule announced: 15 December, 2025
*   Devroom takes place: **31 January, 2026**

## Suggested Topics

* Evolution of new database architecture for cloud native environments (e.g., to address scalability, elasticity, reliability)
* Integrating AI/ML workloads with distributed databases
* How to ease/streamline database migration (especially from legacy databases)
* Achieving database upgrades without downtime
* How to benchmark and tune distributed databases
* Query optimization for cloud native databases
* Tools/methodologies for monitoring, observability, optimizations, testing, etc.
* Working with streaming data
* Stories from end-users (both successes and failures)
* Security and compliance for cloud native databases
* State of open-source licenses and database communities
* Emerging trends/use cases

These are just suggestions and we encourage you to be creative with your proposals! You can also view accepted talks from the 2025 devroom at https://archive.fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/databases/.


A few Notes:

*   You must be available in person to present your talk at FOSDEM.
*   Speaking slots are 25 minutes in length (including Q&A) with 5 minutes between sessions. Note that due to time constraints, number of submissions, etc., we may end up offering a slot duration different than 25 minutes. 
*   FOSDEM is a [FLOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) community event, so please ensure your topic is appropriate (i.e., no sales pitches).
